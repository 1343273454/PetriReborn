    "game_info_tip01"                               "1. KVN's have three resource types: gold, lumber and food. Lumber can be gathered almost everywhere; gold generates by gold towers, will be good to build it in safe place; amount of food depends of tents count." 
    "game_info_tip02"                               "2. Petrosyan and his henchmans have access to shop with humorictic tools. There are some arena's nearby to raise his humoritic power. They works only at daytime. It's recommended to use it to get gold and expirience. Petrosyan's army must search and laugh KVN's at night."
